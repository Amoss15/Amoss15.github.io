        <h2>Interesting Things About Me</h2><br>

        <h5>Received an MFA in Writing</h5>
        <p>I received my MFA in Television, Film, and Theater Arts with an option in Writing at California State University, Los Angeles.
        One of the best things about graduating from the program is the variety of work that I was able to do -
        I wasn't constrained to one medium. I was able to explore so many different types of writing, and if it wasn't for my lack of
        contacts in the gaming industry, my thesis would've been a full-fledged sci-fi video game script. But alas, my thesis became a
        wonderful sci-fi feature screenplay instead.</p>

        <h5>Born in Alaska and Raised in Germany</h5>
        <p>My father enlisted in the Army before I was born, which led to moving around quite a lot every few years. Between the ages of
        10 and 18, I lived in Germany - Bad Kreuznach and Hanau - only returning to the states once in 1999 to visit my home state of
        California. </p>
